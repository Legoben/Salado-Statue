A class that makes it easier to interact with the lighting system.
###Important Notes
- If you want to use binary input instead of hexadecimal you can pass the `hexinput=False` parameter to the loadPattern function.
- This code will only run on a Raspberry Pi using the Raspian operating system due to the use of `RPi.GPIO`.
